![](Intro_image.jpg)

## Introduction

This is an excel project on HiCi LTD. HiCi Ltd is a company which deals mainly in the exportation of local food such as herbs and 
spices, nuts, meats, fish and its products and so many other foods. It is expanding to the 
European Union and as a result had to encounter risks of product rejection and detaining of 
the consignment as reported by the EU Food Safety Standard Agency. It also needs to 
overcome various regulatory hurdles to be able to penetrate the European Union market. 
The hurdles include border rejection and mass destruction of substandard product among 
others.

### Highest risk food products

![](Highest_risk_food_products.png)

Going by the above insights, it will be worthy to note that the food product with the highest 
risk is nuts, nut products and seeds. This is because itâ€™s the most rejected food by the 
European Union member countries probably due to non-compliance with the EU food safety 
standards. Also, according to the data, Sudan is the country of origin of the most rejected 
foods. This particular food product (nuts, nut products and seeds) is a product of Sudan and 
consequently risk rejection which might be as a result of improper handling and 
consequently contamination. 


### Nuts, nut product and seed risk

![](Nuts_nut_product_and_seed_risk.png)

Nuts, nut products and seeds have risk of food poisoning, product rejection, then border 
control which could cause the consignment to be detained, released or under customs. And 
the highest of the risks is consignment detained which means that the products would not 
be in the market not to talk of recording sales.

### Recommendations and Conclusion

The food products that HiCi Ltd should focus on are those with the lowest risk. These include 
but not limited to confectionery, cereals and bakery products, dietetic foods and food 
supplements, cocoa and cocoa preparations, coffee and tea. 

HiCi Ltd should also focus on food products from countries of origin with the lowest number 
of rejections, such as Chad, Tunisia, Tanzania and a host of others. HiCi Ltd should ensure 
that these food products meet the European Union food safety standards to reduce the risk 
of rejection.
